upgrade:
  - New config section ``volumes`` with new config option
    ``[volumes]backups_enabled`` (defaults to ``True``).
    Operators that do not have Cinder backup service deployed in their cloud
    are encouraged to set this option to ``False``.
fixes:
  - Allow to configure Heat service to forbid creation of stacks containing
    Volume resources with ``deletion_policy`` set to ``Snapshot`` when there
    is no Cinder backup service available.

  Previously the event list REST API call only returned events for the
  specified stack even when that stack contained nested stack resources. This
  meant that fetching all nested events required an inefficient recursive
  client-side implementation.
features:
- The event list GET REST API call now has a different behaviour when the
  'nested_depth' parameter is set to an integer greater than zero. The response
  will contain all events down to the requested nested depth.
- When 'nested_depth' is set the response also includes an extra entry in the
  'links' list with 'rel' set to 'root_stack'. This can be used by client side
  implementations to detect whether it is necessary to fall back to client-side
  recurisive event fetching.
